# ScrollLing

**ScrollLing** is an interactive PWA designed to make learning foreign languages engaging and fun through a dynamic, scroll-based interface.

## About The Project

The core idea behind ScrollLing is to transform the routine task of memorizing vocabulary into a fast-paced, addictive game. Instead of static flashcards, users interact with a dynamic feed or a "wheel of fortune," scrolling through words, discovering associations, and building phrases.

### Key Features

*   **Interactive Word Feed:** An endless stream of words with translations and visual cues.
*   **Part-of-Speech Spinner:** Swap words within a sentence with synonyms or other words of the same type (nouns, verbs, etc.) and see the result instantly.
*   **Image Associations:** Each word is paired with an image to enhance memory retention.
*   **Adaptive PWA:** A fully responsive app that works on any device and can be installed on the home screen.

## Built With

*   **Backend:** Python, Flask, uWSGI
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
*   **Architecture:** Progressive Web App (PWA)
